# 📚 College of Computer Science - Imam University

## 🌐 About the Project
This web application is developed as a final project for the College of Computer Science at Imam University. It provides students with a centralized platform to access essential resources, including the latest news, training courses, boot camps, hackathons, and university clubs. The goal is to streamline the process of finding and engaging in academic and extracurricular activities while offering an intuitive and interactive user experience.

This project adheres to strict development standards, including semantic HTML, object-oriented JavaScript with ES6 classes, and a robust backend using Node.js and MongoDB. Authentication is enforced to ensure secure user access, and all data is persistently stored in MongoDB without relying on local file systems.
