# 📚 College of Computer Science - Imam University

## 🌐 About the Project
This web application is developed as a final project for the College of Computer Science at Imam University. It provides students with a centralized platform to access essential resources, including the latest news, training courses, boot camps, hackathons, and university clubs. The goal is to streamline the process of finding and engaging in academic and extracurricular activities while offering an intuitive and interactive user experience.

This project adheres to strict development standards, including semantic HTML, object-oriented JavaScript with ES6 classes, and a robust backend using Node.js and MongoDB. Authentication is enforced to ensure secure user access, and all data is persistently stored in MongoDB without relying on local file systems.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Enhancing Information Accessibility**: Providing a well-organized, easily accessible platform for all students.
- **Encouraging Student Engagement**: Allowing students to discover and participate in various events, competitions, and student clubs.
- **Supporting Technical Events**: Making it easier for students to find and register for hackathons, boot camps, and courses.
- **Efficient Content Management**: Enabling authorized administrators to update content seamlessly.
- **Facilitating Event Registrations**: Ensuring students can register for events efficiently through an integrated portal.
- **Providing Community Interaction**: Offering dedicated pages for student clubs, complete with social media links and event details.
- **Implementing Authentication**: Ensuring user security through a login system that validates user access at every stage.
